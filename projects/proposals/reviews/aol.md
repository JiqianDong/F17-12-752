#General comments:
I need more details on the methods and how you will apply them to the dataset in question.

#Detailed comments:

Here are some questions I had while reading the proposal:

- Why use logistic regression? Can you elaborate on why this is an appropriate regression model? What are the regressors and regressand?
- Step 2 is very high-level. How exactly do you plan to use HMMs and k-Means in this context? What are the hidden states and/or clusters you expect to extract? Please elaborate.
- What specific metrics will you use to compare results?
