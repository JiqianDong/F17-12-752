# General comments:
This proposal had many grammatical/spelling errors so I would start by recommending that these problems are resolved before submitting the final project report.
The description of the project goals and methods used was very high-level and made it very hard for me to understand what the group will be doing.  
I am not sure I understood the main idea for the project but, if I did, a related concept that would help your process would be the EPA EnergyStar program, which has a scoring system for evaluating the energy efficiency of different buildings and benchmarking them. There is an associated dataset called CBECS that could be good for your project.

Here are some references to that:

# Detailed comments:
I have no detailed comments because there is not enough information in the proposal for me to provide constructive feedback on the idea.
