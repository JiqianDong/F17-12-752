#General comments:
I need more details on the methods and how you will apply them, as well as more informatino about the datset you will be using.

#Detailed comments:

Here are some questions I had while reading the proposal:

- What specific type of regression model will you be using? Can you write down the regressors and regressand, as well as the model form (i.e., the regression equation)?
- What temporal resolution will you be working with? Monthly averages of temperature and electricity demand?
- Where will you get the data from?
- What if the relationship is not linear (as it very well could be the case)?
- What is the purpose of clustering in your project?
- Sounds like you want to do some hypothesis testing on the regression coefficients to get a scientific and statistically interesting answer from your project.
