# General comments:
I need more specific information on the model type and what data you will be using.

# Detailed comments:

Here are some questions I had while reading the proposal:

- What is the title for your project (or paper)?
- What do you mean by an "indicator"?
- What is "best" on the first sentence of the problem formulation? How do you quantify this?
- How do you quantify "significant effects" on the energy consumption?
- Data requirements: I think it will be difficult (if not impossible) to find the data that you are requesting for the Hunt library.
- What is the regression model? How will you fit it? And how is PCA being used afterwards? This isn't clear. Lasso for feature selection sounds like a good idea, though. What would be the metric you use to determine whether a model is better than others? Log-likelihood? R^2?
