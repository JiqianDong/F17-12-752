# General comments:
Interesting idea but I need more details on the methods and, more importantly, how you plan to obtain a representative dataset for your chosen problem. Frankly, though, I think you're better off reducing the scope substantially (by, say, synthentically generating fraudulent datasets from a normal set of building meter data) or changing scope.

# Detailed comments:
Here are some questions I had while reading the proposal:

- What dataset will you be using for this project, then? These datasets are hard to come by so I would begin considering an alternate project if you can't find one this week.
- Validation will be super tough, too.
- What specific methods will you use, and how?
