# General comments:
The general idea sounds good, though I worry about there being only 3 sub-meters in the dataset. These sub-meters have more than one appliance under each, and this could complicate matters.
I was also not sure how exactly you will approach the problem (i.e., how do you plan to do the disaggregation). How does clustering help here? 

# Detailed comments:
Here are some questions I had while reading the proposal:

- What algorithm will you be implementing for the disaggregation?
- What exploratory data analysis will you do?
- How will you evaluate whether or not your project was successful? What metrics will you use?
