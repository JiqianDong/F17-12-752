# General comments:
To provide you with better feedback I need more information regarding the method of choice, how you will implement it (exact equation and resoluiton of the variables), and metrics you will use to evaluate performance. I wasn't very clear about the purpose of this forecasting model. There is a lot of work on load forecasting and you would do well at least searching in Google Scholar for them and reading the titles/abstract to get a good idea on what is the state-of-the-art. 

# Detailed comments:
Here are some questions I had while reading the proposal:

- What is the the main goal of the project? Is it to generate a regression model that can accurately forecast electricity consumption for a single residential building?
- What temporal horizon will these forecasts be made for? 1 week? 1 month? 1 year?
- What temporal resolution will the model use? 1-minute intervals? Monthly averages?
- What will this forecast be used for? What metric will you use to evaluate the performance of the forecasting model?
- What is "curve regression"? Can you specify the model in mathematical terms?
