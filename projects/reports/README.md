# Final Project Reports

Please submit your final project reports in this folder by following these instructions:

1) Checkout a copy of the most recent version of the git repository on your computer (if you haven't done so already).
1) Within this folder (projects/reporst/), create a sub-folder named using one of the AndrewIDs of the members of your team (any particular AndrewID is fine).
2) Inside that folder, create a Markdown file called (members.md) that lists all of your team members and their AndrewIDs.
3) Create a file called final-report.pdf that contains your final report as a PDF file following the formatting requirements for 4-page Notes papers in BuildSys. Details on that formatting can be found [here](http://buildsys.acm.org/2017/cfp/).
4) Once you have all of these, commit your changes to the local repository and then push them to the master branch using git.

You should do all of this before the end of Sunday December 18th (i.e., before 11:59pm EST on that day).
