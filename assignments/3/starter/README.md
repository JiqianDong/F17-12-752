# Assignment \#3 Starter

These files are from the 2015 version of the course. They contain Assignment \#2 of that year, and its solution.

Some caveats:

- The paper we were using is Paper 2b in our course (i.e., the one with filename 2\_mathieu.pdf). It has a similar model, but it is not exactly the same notation.
- The solution is not entirely correct, so just use it as a guide for getting unstuck on the problem, or to help you think about the problem.
- Though this approach to solve the problem works and can lead you to fully understand the way the regression model is implemented, you may have an easier time finding a proper solution by using a linear regression package such as the one contained in the *statsmodel* package for Python.
